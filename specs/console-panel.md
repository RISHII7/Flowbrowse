# Console Panel — prompts

The canvas already lights up nodes live (running / failed). Now we add the bottom
**console**: a logs list of every run's steps, and an output inspector for whichever
step you click. Three prompts, run one at a time.

First, install the duration formatter:

```bash
npm install pretty-ms
```

---

## Prompt 1 — get the run data in place

```text
I want a console under the canvas that shows what each run did — a list of every
run and its steps, and clicking a step shows what that step produced, or its
error if it failed, plus how long it took.

Right now a run step only records its node id and status in
@features/workflows/tasks/run-workflow.ts, so there's nothing to show yet.

Make each step track everything the console will show: which node it is (for its
icon and title), its status as it moves from pending to running to done or failed,
how long it took, whatever it output, and its error if it threw.

Then expose that run data from
@features/workflows/components/workflow-runs-provider.tsx so a panel can read every
run and its steps.

Don't build the UI yet — just get the data in place.
```

## Prompt 2 — the logs list

```text
Build a console panel below the canvas that lists workflow runs: every run and,
below it, its steps.

Each step shows its node's icon, its title, and how long it took (format the
duration with pretty-ms). A step spins while it's running, turns red if it failed,
and looks inactive if it never ran. Clicking a step selects it, clicking again
deselects.

The accent-colored node icon already exists as NodeIcon in
@features/workflows/components/right-sidebar.tsx — reuse it instead of building
another.

Build the runs list as a LogsPanel and wrap it in a ConsolePanel that owns the
selection, both new components in the workflows feature's components folder.

Then mount the ConsolePanel in
@features/workflows/components/workflow-shell.tsx, where it currently shows a "Logs"
placeholder.
```

## Prompt 3 — the output inspector

```text
The workflow console below the canvas
(@features/workflows/components/console-panel.tsx) lists each run's steps and lets
you select one.

Add an output view showing the selected step's result: its output as formatted
JSON, its error if it failed, or a short note when there's nothing.

Build it as an InspectorPanel in the workflows feature's components folder,
rendered inside the ConsolePanel next to the logs and only while a step is
selected.
```
